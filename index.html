      <h3>Who is Sony-Shock?</h3>
      <p class="who">
        Sony-Shock describes themselves as a "USA-based Spanish artist who loves
        food" who is "focused on cartoony, colorful illustration" as per their
        <a href="https://sony-shock.carrd.co/">official carrd.</a> <br />Their
        style features stylized cartoons that are mostly comprised of
        commissioned work of other people's characters. Along with that, they
        also have a youtube channel in which they feature speedpaints (or,
        sped-up videos of themselves drawing digitally) of their commissioned
        work. <br />Sony-Shock is also a contracted artist for the successful
        video game <i>The Binding of Isaac</i> and it's side-projects.

    <h3>What makes Sony-Shock the GOAT?</h3>
    <div class="info-bar">
      <h5>From a Fan's Perspective</h5>
      <p>
        What pops out the most from an onlooker's perspective in Sony-Shock's
        work is their bright colors and the cartoonish features of their
        characters. Someone would be able to describe Sony-Shock's Artwork as
        "soft", "warm", and "cute." This is all true! Anyone who looks at
        Sony-Shock's pieces would be immediately transfixed by the use of bright
        colors paired with soft appearances as featured by their style.

      <h5>From an Artist's Perspective</h5>
      <p>
        Anyone can see why Sony-Shock's artwork looks so pleasing, but their
        work gets exponentially more impressive while looking at it from an
        artist's point of view. Sony-Shock has been able to showcase an
        impression that they are extremely well-learned when it comes to drawing
        from real life. This isn't immediately clear to an onlooker without
        artistic experience, but Sony-Shock's expertise is exceptionally clear
        when an artist views their work. You can tell from the way that they
        handle their cartoonish anatomy and the vibrancy of colors, down to the
        folds in the clothing, that Sony-Shock is not afraid of using references
        and studying from the real world in order to get their desired results.
